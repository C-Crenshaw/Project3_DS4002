# Data for Project 3

The original dataset used for this project was dervied from [The World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/). The data was subsequently cleaned and packaged for the analysis conducted. This process is extensively noted in the repository README.md file. 

The excel file is the raw data originally taken from the World Happiness Report website. The csv file is the cleaned data used in the completion of this project cycle.
