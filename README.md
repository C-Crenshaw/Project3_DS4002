## Description
MI3 deliverable for the third project cycle of DS 4002. <br />

The objective of this project is to determine which life evaluation factors are associated with high national happiness scores and to construct a time-series regression model utilizing the predetermined factors to successfully predict future happiness scores. This project group will attempt to fulfill this objective by answering the following questions: Are individual evaluations of life satisfaction indicative of a nation’s happiness in the aggregate? If a correlation can be established between happiness and life evaluations, can these regressors accurately predict a country’s happiness in the near future? How can a predictive model for happiness be leveraged by policymakers in the implementation of new national programs? This project hopes to highlight which socioeconomic components of a nation are most important for the well-being of its citizens in order to achieve a stronger social fabric and better public welfare.
