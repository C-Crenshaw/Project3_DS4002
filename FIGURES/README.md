# Figures Folder for Project 3

This folder contains all the figures utilized for the completion of Project 3. The final project presentation will be included within this folder (MI4).

All exploratory data analysis graphics incorporate an interactive element to them. Although all images are provided in this folder, they can only be shared as .png files. An illustration of the interactive capacity of the graphics is shown through the inclusion of a single .mov file, [HappinessScorevsGDP.mov](https://github.com/C-Crenshaw/Project3_DS4002/blob/38fc8a1b11ad7e61cc7b7d50de5041ab4bb319d3/FIGURES/HappinessScorevsGDP.mov). 

To run the graphics, open the linked Google Colaboratory file under the SRC folder.
